# ðŸš€ CritCoin Platform - Quick Start

## For University Windows Machines

**Just run these 2 commands - that's it!**

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm run setup

# 2. Start the application
npm start
```

Then open: **https://localhost:3000**

*(Accept the security certificate warning - this is normal for development)*

---

## Alternative Commands

**If `npm start` doesn't work, try:**

```bash
# Backend (Terminal 1)
cd backend
npm run dev

# Frontend (Terminal 2)  
cd frontend
npm start
```

**For Windows-specific issues:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run start-windows
```
